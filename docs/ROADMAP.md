# Research & Build Roadmap

- v1: PoC circuits (threshold & sanctions-set membership), CLI proof, local verification, tests.
- v2: On-chain verifier with registry, event logs for auditable compliance attestations.
- v3: Expand predicates: velocity checks, structuring detection (rolling windows), multi-asset.
- v4: Link to real policy texts; formal threat model; transparency report; performance eval.
- v5: Move to Plonk/Halo2; universal setup; recursive proofs; privacy-preserving analytics.
