# Privacy Statement

- The design avoids disclosing raw transaction data; only zero-knowledge proofs and commitments are shared.
- Example data in `data/` is synthetic and anonymized.
- Regulators verify compliance predicates (e.g., sender not sanctioned, amount thresholds) without learning underlying values.
